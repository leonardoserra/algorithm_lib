# algorithm_lib

> Creating this module, this will help me study algorithm 
> while implementing it into this library  
  
Currently Implemented Algorithms:  
- Linear Search  
- Binary Search  
- Bubble Sort  
  
> How to use:
> from outside the package:  
`python -um algorithm_lib.bubble_sort -a "9 8 6 5 3 4 2 7.55 6 5 0.98 9"`
output: `['0.98', '2', '3', '4', '5', '5', '6', '6', '7.55', '8', '9', '9']`
